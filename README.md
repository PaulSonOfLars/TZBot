# TZBot
Based on Python2, this bot started with the idea of making SSH connections easier by returning the IP of the server used for SSH. Now, TZBot is growing to be much more than just an IP bot for SSH

To use it, make sure you have Python2 installed first
Then you need to install python-telegram-bot with `pip install python-telegram-bot --upgrade`

The bot will save a "/data" folder where the bot will store all it's data
